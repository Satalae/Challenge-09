# README Generator 
## Description 

  Seeing the struggle of my classmates and I when it came to generating a professional ReadMe, I had decided that it was time to simply make an easy template for which to generate a professional ReadMe whenever it was needed! This program will solve the problem of needing to take the time to remember proper ReadMe formatting, and will also do away with grabbing the correct links for licensing and your repositories with just the simple run of node index.js!

  ## Walkthrough 

  The usage of this program is quite simple. After installation, you need simply open up your git terminal, navigate to the pull location, and run the command "node index.js". You will then be ran through a series of questions that will be used to generate your readme! 
 
  Appended below is a tutorial video on this process!
